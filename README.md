# Hotel-Booking-System-Data-analysis
Hotel reservation management with Python and data analysis with Power BI

Hello and welcome to my first end-to-end project!
This project includes a python script that acts as a reservation manager for the bookings of a hotel. The hotel employee has to choose between 5 menu options. 1. New Booking 
                                   2. Show Available Rooms
                                   3. View Bookings
                                   4. Cancel booking
                                   5. Exit

1. This option creates a new booking by comparing the customer's requested check-in and check-out dates for a chosen room type (Single, Double, Suite) with the hotel’s existing reservations and automatically finds the first available. If no room is available, the system suggests alternative dates (+/- 2 days) and the customer selects either one of the available options or to exit without booking a room. If the customer selects to book the room, he gives his personal info and the booking is confirmed. I also have to say that:
     a) Dynamic pricing – The booking price is calculated dynamically based on: 1.Room type availability, 2.Seasonality 3.Early booking or last-minute discounts
     b) Customer recognition – Returning customers are identified by comparing their email or phone number, and they retain the same customer ID.
     c) All inputs are validated to prevent invalid or missing data.
     d) Booking and customer data are saved in JSON files for persistence.
     e) Cancelation number calculating inside the code.

   


3. The option 2 takes as input check in and check out dates and gives the available rooms in that dates.

4. The option 3 gives to the employee the list of the upcoming bookings with the bookings info of each.

5. Allows the employee to cancel an existing reservation using the customer ID.

6. This option just exiting the loop.


In the second phase, the project integrates Power BI for data analysis and visualization.
Power BI imports the two JSON files (bookings.json and customers.json) generated by the Python program.
Using these datasets, a dashboard is created to analyze the hotel’s performance during the April–October operating season.
The dashboard includes key metrics such as:
1.Total bookings per month
2.Revenue trends
3.Average booking value
4.Booking distribution by customer type (new vs returning)
5.Cancellation rates

This project is a **hotel booking management system** combined with a **data analysis dashboard**.  
It demonstrates how hotel reservations can be managed, analyzed, and visualized using **Python** and **Power BI**.
