# 🏨 Hotel Booking System & Data Analysis

**Hotel reservation management with Python and data analysis with Power BI**

---

## 👋 Introduction

Hello and welcome to my first end-to-end project!  
This project includes a Python script that acts as a **reservation manager** for hotel bookings and a **Power BI dashboard** for performance analysis.

The Python program simulates the hotel employee’s booking system with **five main menu options:**

1. **New Booking**  
2. **Show Available Rooms**  
3. **View Bookings**  
4. **Cancel Booking**  
5. **Exit**

---

## 🧾 Features Overview

### 1️⃣ New Booking
- Creates a new booking by comparing the customer’s requested check-in and check-out dates with existing reservations.  
- Automatically finds the first available room for the selected type (**Single, Double, Suite**).  
- If no room is available, the system suggests **alternative dates (+/- 2 days)**.  
- The customer can confirm the booking by providing their personal details.

**Additional functionalities:**
- 🧮 **Dynamic Pricing** — Based on:
  1. Room type availability  
  2. Seasonality  
  3. Early booking or last-minute discounts  
- 👤 **Customer Recognition** — Returning customers are matched by email or phone number and retain the same customer ID.  
- ✅ **Input Validation** — Prevents invalid or missing entries.  
- 💾 **Data Persistence** — Bookings and customer data are saved in **JSON files**.  
- ❌ **Cancellation Number** — Automatically generated within the code.

---

### 2️⃣ Show Available Rooms
Takes check-in and check-out dates as input and returns all available rooms within that range.

---

### 3️⃣ View Bookings
Displays a list of all **upcoming reservations** along with detailed booking information.

---

### 4️⃣ Cancel Booking
Allows the employee to cancel an existing reservation by providing the **customer ID**.

---

### 5️⃣ Exit
Simply exits the main program loop.

## 📊 Data Analysis with Power BI

In the second phase, Power BI imports the two JSON files generated by the Python program:
- `bookings.json`
- `customers.json`

Using these datasets, a **dashboard** is built to analyze the hotel’s performance during the **April–October operating season**, including:

- 📅 Total bookings per month  
- 💰 Revenue trends  
- 💵 Average booking value  
- 👥 Booking distribution (new vs returning customers)  
- ❌ Cancellation rates

## 💡 Summary

This project is a **hotel booking management system** combined with a **data analysis dashboard**.  
It demonstrates how hotel reservations can be **managed, analyzed, and visualized** using **Python** and **Power BI**.

## 🧠 Data Disclaimer

All datasets used in this project are **synthetic and AI-generated**, created solely to demonstrate data analysis and visualization in Power BI.  
No real hotel, guest, or business data has been used.
